        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>In the field of law and psychology, the term "child" holds distinct significance. Webster International Dictionary provides the following definitions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A young person of either sex between infancy and youth:</strong> This refers to an individual in the early stages of development, beyond infancy but before reaching the more mature stage of youth.</li>
                <li><strong>One who exhibits characteristics of a young person:</strong> In this context, a "child" is defined by the traits and behaviors commonly associated with youthfulness.</li>
                <li><strong>A person who has not come of age:</strong> This definition underscores the concept that a child is someone who hasn't yet reached the legal age of adulthood.</li>
                <li><strong>A person under a legally specified age of 18 years:</strong> Legally, the definition of a child often includes an age criterion, such as being under 18 years old.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These definitions are crucial in legal, psychological, and societal contexts, helping establish the rights, responsibilities, and protections granted to individuals during their developmental years.</p>

          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>The rights of children are rooted in their unique developmental needs, acknowledging their physical, mental, and emotional immaturity. Several aspects emphasize the importance of these rights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dependency and Care:</strong> Both young and older children require special care due to their physical, mental, and emotional immaturity. Young children are entirely dependent, while older children may struggle with making informed choices, thus necessitating protection and guidance.</li>
                <li><strong>Nurturing for Responsible Adulthood:</strong> Individuals under 18 years of age need nurturing and guidance to mature into responsible and productive adults. This developmental phase is vital as these individuals will eventually assume roles in society's functioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Family Foundation:</strong> The nurturing and protection of children begin within the family unit, fostering an environment of happiness, love, and understanding. A supportive family environment contributes significantly to a child's well-being.</li>
                <li><strong>Extension to Society:</strong> The concept of children's rights extends beyond the family into society as a whole. This is achieved through well-crafted legislation that ensures children's freedom, dignity, and security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recognizing these needs underscores the importance of creating a protective and nurturing environment for children, both within their families and through societal frameworks.</p>
