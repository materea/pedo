            <p>Cancer refers to a group of diseases in which there is abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.</p>
            <p>A cancer is thought to develop from a cell in which the normal mechanisms for control of growth and proliferation are altered.</p>
            <p>Current evidence supports the concept of carcinogenesis as a multistage process that is genetically regulated.</p>
            <p>The first step in this process is initiation, which requires exposure of normal cells to carcinogenic substances.</p>
            <p>Substances that may act as carcinogens or initiators include chemical, physical, and biologic agents.</p>
            <p>Two major classes of genes are involved in carcinogenesis: oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.</p>

                  <li>Carcinomas are malignant growths arising from epithelial cells.</li>
                  <li>Sarcomas are malignant growths of muscle or connective tissue.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Tumors have several distinct characteristics:</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Invasion and Tissue Destruction:</strong> Tumors have the ability to invade and destroy the surrounding healthy tissue, which can lead to complications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Genetic Instability:</strong> Tumor cells often exhibit genetic instability, leading to changes in their DNA that contribute to their uncontrolled growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Altered Cell Architecture:</strong> Loss of normal cell architecture results in atypical cells that no longer resemble their original tissue of origin.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loss of Functional Abilities:</strong> Tumor cells lose the ability to perform their usual functions, further compromising the affected tissues and organs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Metastasis:</strong> Many tumors have the capacity to metastasize, meaning they can spread to distant parts of the body. This often leads to recurrences even after removal or destruction of the primary tumor.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Topographic Site:</strong> Cancers can be classified based on their specific location within the body, which is important for diagnosis and treatment planning.</li>
              <li><strong>Histology:</strong> Histology refers to the study of the microscopic structure of tissues and cells. It is used to categorize cancers based on the types of cells and tissue patterns involved in the tumor.</li>
              <li><strong>Anatomic Extent (Staging):</strong> Staging involves determining the size of the tumor, its extent within the organ or tissue, and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant parts of the body. Staging helps in prognosis and treatment decision-making.</li>
            </ol>

              <h4>Reasons for Staging</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>To aid the clinician in planning treatment:</strong> Staging helps clinicians determine the most appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients.</li>
                <li><strong>To give some indication of prognosis:</strong> Staging provides valuable information about the likely outcome of the disease, influencing decisions about patient care.</li>
                <li><strong>To assist in evaluating the results of treatment:</strong> Staging allows healthcare providers to assess the effectiveness of treatments and make adjustments if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>To facilitate the exchange of information between treatment centers:</strong> Standardized staging systems enable consistent communication and collaboration among healthcare institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>To contribute to continuing investigations of human malignancies:</strong> Staging data aids in ongoing research to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Anatomic Staging</h4>
              <p>Anatomic staging is based on three components:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>T (Tumor):</strong> This component assesses the extent of the primary tumor within the body.</li>
                <li><strong>N (Node):</strong> It evaluates the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node involvement, which indicates the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>M (Metastasis):</strong> This component determines the absence or presence of distant metastasis, which indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>Limitations of Cancer Classification:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Not used in hematologic malignancies:</strong> Hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, often follow different staging systems. For example, the Ann Arbor Staging System is used for lymphomas.</li>
                <li><strong>Rarely used in pediatric cancer:</strong> Staging systems are less commonly applied to childhood cancers due to their unique characteristics and treatment approaches.</li>

                      <li><strong>Tumor Debulking:</strong> Surgical resection to reduce cancer size is sometimes done when removing all the cancer is impossible.</li>
                      <li><strong>Palliative Surgery:</strong> To relieve symptoms and preserve the quality of life is reasonable even when a cure is unlikely or when an attempt at extensive surgery is precluded.</li>
                      <li><strong>Reconstructive Surgery:</strong> Used to restore form and function after cancer surgery, especially when organs or tissues have been removed.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Local Therapy:</strong> Radiation therapy is a localized treatment that targets a specific area of the body affected by cancer, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.</li>
                      <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> It causes DNA damage to cancer cells, disrupting their ability to divide and grow, ultimately leading to their death.</li>
                      <li><strong>Curative Potential:</strong> In some cases, radiation therapy alone may have curative potential, especially when cancer is localized and hasn't spread extensively.</li>
                      <li><strong>Adjunctive and Neoadjuvant Use:</strong> Radiation therapy is also used as an adjunct (additional therapy) or neoadjuvant (preliminary therapy before surgery) approach to enhance the effectiveness of other treatments, such as surgery or chemotherapy.</li>
                      <li><strong>Palliative Role:</strong> Besides curative intent, radiation therapy can provide palliation by relieving symptoms and improving the quality of life for patients, even when a cure is not achievable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Adverse Effects of Radiotherapy</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Acute Adverse Effects:</strong> Depend on the area receiving radiation and may include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Lethargy.</li>
                          <li>Fatigue.</li>
                          <li>Mucositis.</li>
                          <li>Dermatologic manifestations (erythema, pruritus, desquamation).</li>
                          <li>Esophagitis.</li>
                          <li>Pneumonitis.</li>
                          <li>Hepatitis.</li>
                          <li>Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tenesmus).</li>
                          <li>Genitourinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria).</li>
                          <li>Bone marrow suppression.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Late Complications:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Cataracts, keratitis, and retina damage if the eye is in the treatment field.</li>
                          <li>Hypopituitarism, xerostomia, hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, pericarditis, esophageal stricture, hepatitis, ulcers, gastritis, nephritis, sterility, muscle contractures, and arteriosclerotic heart disease, depending upon the area treated.</li>
                          <li>Radiation that reaches normal tissue can lead to poor healing of the tissues if further procedures or surgery is necessary.</li>
                          <li>Radiation therapy can increase the risk of developing other cancers, particularly leukemias, sarcomas, and carcinomas of the thyroid or breast.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Multidrug Regimens:</strong> Chemotherapy often involves using multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action and varying toxicities. This approach aims to increase treatment efficacy, reduce dose-related toxicity, and decrease the probability of drug resistance.</li>
                      <li><strong>Mechanisms of Action:</strong> Chemotherapy drugs act by causing DNA damage, RNA damage, inhibiting cell growth and division, and interfering with vital cellular processes, often referred to as antimetabolites.</li>
                      <li><strong>Use Cases (CRAB):</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Curative:</strong> Some cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, can be treated with chemotherapy with the intent of achieving a cure.</li>
                          <li><strong>Relief of Symptoms or Partial Remission:</strong> In cases where a complete cure is not possible, chemotherapy can be used to alleviate symptoms and achieve partial remission.</li>
                          <li><strong>Adjunct and Basal:</strong> Chemotherapy may be used as an adjunct to reduce tumor mass before other treatments like surgery or radiotherapy, especially in solid tumors like Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Principles of Combination Chemotherapy</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Targeting Different Cell Cycle Phases:</strong> Combination chemotherapy aims to target different phases of the cell cycle, maximizing cell kill and reducing the likelihood of drug resistance.</li>
                      <li><strong>Drug Selection:</strong> Drugs used in combination should individually have activity against the tumor, and those with maximal efficacy are preferred.</li>
                      <li><strong>Mechanisms of Action:</strong> The chosen drugs should have different mechanisms of action to allow for additive or synergistic effects when combined and should be dosed at their optimal doses and schedules.</li>
                      <li><strong>Minimally Overlapping Toxicities:</strong> The toxicities of the chosen drugs should be minimally overlapping to reduce the risk of life-threatening toxicity to a single organ system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Cell Cycle and Chemotherapy</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Cell Cycle Phases:</strong> The cell cycle consists of four stages: mitosis, gap 1, synthesis phase (S phase), and gap 2.</li>
                      <li><strong>DNA Synthesis:</strong> DNA synthesis occurs in the S phase, while mitosis involves chromosome alignment, separation, and cell division.</li>
                      <li><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong> Chemotherapy drugs cause cell death by apoptosis, either directly interfering with DNA or targeting key proteins required for cell division.</li>
                    </ul>

                              <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Examples of active immune therapy include cancer cell vaccines alone or in combination with adjuvants, which enhance the desired immune response.</li>
                              <li><strong>Monoclonal Antibodies:</strong> Another approach is using monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD-1L). These antibodies aim to release a patient's immune system response, which may be suppressed by the cancer through PD-1 or PD-1L mediated mechanisms.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4>Adoptive Immune Therapy</h4>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Mediated by Passive Immunity:</strong> Adoptive immune therapy is mediated by passive immunity.</li>
                              <li><strong>Process:</strong> It involves administering anticancer antibodies or cells to a patient with cancer.</li>
                              <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Monoclonal antibodies directed against lineage-specific antigens. These antibodies may be linked to a toxin or radionuclide to increase efficacy.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Widely Used Example:</strong> Rituximab is a widely used example, particularly in patients with lymphomas.</li>
                                  <li>Another approach is to give T cells or natural-killer (NK) cells from a healthy person to someone with cancer.</li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4>Targeted Therapy</h4>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Targeted therapy involves therapies directed against a specific gene or gene product that is thought to be important in the cause or progression of cancer.</li>
                              <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, in chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer caused by a specific mutation (BCR-ABL1).</li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4>Vaccines</h4>
                            <p>Vaccines are designed to prevent virus-related cancers. Examples include:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Vaccines against human papilloma virus that can prevent cervical and anal cancers (and possibly and head and neck and tonsil cancers) and</li>
                              <li>Hepatitis B vaccine that can prevent liver cancer.</li>
                            </ul>
