                <li>Additionally, a tendency exists for a variety of tissues to undergo malignant transformation.</li>
                <li>The disease occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 live births and is transmitted as a dominant trait with variable expression but virtually complete penetrance by the age of 5 years. </li>
                <li>No parental age effect occurs. </li>
                <li>It is the most common single-gene defect to affect the nervous system. </li>
                <li>Approximately one-half of the cases appear to be sporadic, and the mutation rate has been estimated at 1 in 10,000 gametes per generation, one of the highest mutation rates in humans.</li>
                <li>The gene for NF1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 17</li>
                <li>The gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein, named NEUROFIBROMIN.</li>

                        <li>Neurofibromas are the most common type of tumors, but schwannomas also can be seen.</li>
                        <li>Tumors that are prone to develop within the CNS include primarily optic gliomas; pilocystic astrocytomas of the third ventricle, cerebellum, and spinal cord; and high-grade astrocytomas.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, neurofibromatosis has been associated with a number of other neoplastic processes with a greater than random frequency e.g  leukemia, Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, and pheochromocytoma.</li>

                        <li>NF1 is a progressive disease process that can affect almost every organ.</li>
                        <li>When many peripheral lesions are present, few lesions tend to be within the CNS and vice versa.</li>
                        <li>Café-au-lait spots are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis and are present in almost 100% of patients.</li>
                        <li>They are present at birth but increase in size, number, and pigmentation, especially during the first few years of life. </li>
                        <li>The spots are scattered over the body surface, with predilection for the trunk and extremities, with sparing of the face.</li>
                        <li>Various types of cutaneous tumors can be found. </li>
                        <li>The most characteristic for NF1 is the pedunculated molluscum fibrosum and the subcutaneous neurofibromas.</li>
                        <li>Generally, cutaneous tumors tend to enlarge slowly throughout life.</li>
                        <li>Plexiform neuromas can occur in all affected tissues and lead to hypertrophy of one or more extremity, exophthalmos, or defects of the skull and orbit.</li>
                        <li>Multiple nodules within the iris (iris hamartomas) were first described by Lisch. </li>
                        <li>Lisch nodules are seen in almost all affected individuals aged 21 or more years, but only in one-half of children aged 5 to 6 years.</li>
                        <li>Initially light colored, they become darker with time. Short stature is common</li>
                        <li>A large proportion of these children experiences growth hormone deficiency.</li>
                        <li>Skeletal abnormalities include low cervical or thoracic kyphoscoliosis, scalloping of the posterior portion of the vertebral bodies.</li>
                        <li>Hypertension can develop owing to the presence of a pheochromocytoma, it also can be the result of renal artery stenosis, the most common of a variety of arterial abnormalities seen in neurofibromatosis.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Cognitive Disabilities</li>

                            <li>Tumors of the Peripheral Nerves</li>
                            <li>Intraspinal Tumors</li>
                            <li>Cerebrovascular Accidents</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>About 40% of children with neurofibromatosis have learning disabilities, only a small fraction have severe mental retarded.</li>
                        <li>Intracranial tumors can arise at any time of life, the optic pathway being the most common and the earliest site of involvement.</li>
                        <li>Approximately half of patients who harbor optic pathway tumors develop signs or symptoms such as proptosis and precocious puberty. </li>
                        <li>The latter is seen in approximately 40% of subjects and results from compression of the hypothalamus by the tumor.</li>
                        <li>The presence of precocious puberty in a child with NF1, therefore, should always arouse the suspicion of an enlarging intracranial tumor.</li>
                        <li>Tumors of the peripheral nerves can arise at any age and can involve any of the major nerves.</li>
                        <li>Even though these tumors are occasionally painful, surgical removal must be weighed carefully against the possibility of the procedure producing considerable neurologic deficit. </li>
                        <li>Malignant degeneration of neurofibromas occurs in less than 3% of children, but appears more frequently in adults.</li>
                        <li>Intraspinal tumors are generally slower to develop than intracranial tumors and asymptomatic spinal cord tumors are commonly detected on routine neuroimaging studies. </li>
                        <li>Cerebrovascular accidents are common and can be responsible for the abrupt evolution of neurologic signs.</li>

                <li>Tuberous sclerosis or tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that causes benign tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. </li>
                <li>Approximately one-third of cases are familial, and the rest are new mutations.</li>
                <li>A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems, skin abnormalities, lung and kidney disease. </li>
                <li>It occurs with a frequency of 1 in 6,000 to 15,400 and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant gene.</li>
                <li>It is genetically heterogeneous, with loci on chromosome 9q (TSC1), and 16p (TSC2). </li>
                <li>Each locus accounts for approximately 50% of familial cases.</li>
                <li>TSC1 codes for HAMARTIN, a 130-kd protein with no significant homology to any other known vertebrate protein. </li>
                <li>TSC2 codes for TUBERIN, a 200-kd protein, which functions as a tumor-suppressor gene.</li>

                    <li>The most characteristic gross abnormality is the presence of tubers.</li>
                    <li>These are numerous hard areas of gliotic tissue of varying size, after which this condition is named.</li>
                    <li>On histologic examination they are sclerotic areas that consist of an overgrowth of atypical giant astrocytes, and groups of large, bizarre, and frequently vacuolated “monster cells.”</li>
                    <li>Blood vessels in sclerotic regions show hyaline degeneration of their walls.</li>
                    <li>In approximately half of subjects, calcium is deposited within the gliotic areas to an extent as to be visible on plain radiography of the skull or on computed tomographic (CT) scanning. </li>
                    <li>Subependymal nodules found in the ventricular walls, particularly in the region of the foramen of Monro are multiple small, tumor-like nodules that project into the ventricles and, because of their appearance on pneumoencephalography were described as “candle drippings.”</li>

                    <li>The central nervous system (CNS) lesions seen in this disorder include hamartomas of the cortex, ventricular walls, and subependymal giant cell tumors, which typically develop in the vicinity of the foramina of Monro.</li>

                   <ul>
                    <li>Mental retardation may often due to poor seizure control.</li>
                    <li>Commonest seizures in them is infantile spasm.</li>
                    <li>Cutaneous manifestation include adenoma sebaceum, shagreen patch, ash leaf macules</li>
                    <li>Tumors </li>
                    <li>Adenoma sebaceum (angiofibroma) consist of a red, papular rash over the nose, chin, cheeks, and malar region, appearing between ages 1 and 5 years.</li>
                    <li>Depigmented nevi (ash leaf), are oval areas with irregular margins over the trunk and extremities are equally common.</li>
                    <li>They are more readily visualized when the skin is illuminated with ultraviolet light (Wood lamp). </li>
                    <li>Generally, they appear earlier than the adenoma sebaceum. </li>
                    <li>They can be noted at birth and are seen before 2 years of age in more than one-half of the subject</li>
                    <li>Ash leaf macules differ from vitiligo in that in vitiligo the melanocytes are absent, whereas in depigmented macules the melanocytes are normal, but the melanosomes are reduced and contain less melanin. </li>
                    <li>Of the other cutaneous abnormalities, flattened fibromas are the most common.</li>
                    <li>They appear in a variety of areas, including the trunk, gingivae, and periungual regions.</li>
                    <li>In some infants, fibromas are found along the hairline or eyebrows.</li>
                    <li>Shagreen patch. This is an uneven thickening of skin, grayish green or light brown, raised above the surrounding surface, usually in the posterior lumbosacral region.</li>
                    <li>Café au lait spots are seen in 7% to 16% of subjects.</li>

                <li>First few weeks of life:</li>
                <li>Consists of erythematous linear streaks and plaques of vesicles that are most pronounced on the limbs and circumferentially on the trunk.</li>
                <li>Linear configuration is unique. </li>
                <li>Histopathologically, epidermal edema and eosinophil-filled intraepidermal vesicles are present. </li>
                <li>Eosinophils also infiltrate the adjacent epidermis and dermis.</li>
                <li>Blood eosinophilia up to 65% also is common.</li>
                <li>The first stage generally resolves by 4 month of age.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Second phase</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>As blisters on the distal limbs resolve, they become dry and hyperkeratotic, forming verrucous plaques. </li>
                <li>The verrucous plaques rarely affect the trunk or face and generally involute within 6 mo.</li>
                <li>Epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and papillomatosis are characteristic.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>The third or pigmentary phase</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>It is the hallmark of incontinentia pigmenti.</li>
                <li>It generally develops over weeks to months and may overlap the earlier phases, be evident at birth, or, more commonly, begin to appear within the first few weeks of life. </li>
                <li>Hyperpigmentation more often is apparent on the trunk than the limbs and is distributed in macular whorls, reticulated patches, flecks, and linear streaks that follow Blaschko lines.</li>
                <li>The axillae and groin are invariably affected.</li>
                <li>The sites of involvement are not necessarily those of the preceding vesicular and warty lesions. </li>
                <li>The pigmented lesions, once present, persist throughout childhood.</li>
                <li>They generally begin to fade by early adolescence, however, and often have disappeared by age 16 yr.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Fourth phase</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Hypopigmented, hairless, anhidrotic patches or streaks occur as a late manifestation, they may develop, however, before the hyperpigmentation of stage three has resolved. </li>
                <li>The lesions develop mainly on the flexor aspect of the lower legs and less often on the arms and trunk.</li>
