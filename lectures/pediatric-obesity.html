                <li><strong>Genetic factors</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic factor</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Physical inactivity</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Dietary habits</strong></li>
                <li>Secondary causes also occur, such as the use of steroids in children, which can result in obesity.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Causes of Childhood Obesity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetic factors:</strong> Obesity tends to run in families. Such families have a low metabolism of their foods compared to others. However, it has been found that it is not strictly genetic; dietary factors also contribute.</li>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic factor:</strong> Families with a non-working parent have been found to be a contributing factor to obesity, as they consume more calories than those with working parents.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Cause of Obesity - Physical Inactivity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A lot of children are not active anymore, and the reasons include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sitting in front of TV, video games, etc., for long hours; some tend to eat and munch a lot of junk foods while watching, increasing the risk of obesity.</li>
                    <li>Many schools no longer involve children in outdoor games due to fear of physical injury and potential lawsuits.</li>
                    <li>Fear of abuse (such as kidnapping or pedophilia) if children are allowed to play outside the home.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Causes of Obesity - Dietary Habits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Children's dietary habits have shifted from eating normal healthy meals of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to consuming fast food and junk food due to convenience for some parents.</li>
                <li>Eating when not hungry.</li>
                <li>Consuming high-calorie, unhealthy meals before having a real healthy meal.</li>
                <li>Eating while watching TV or playing video games.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Secondary Causes of Obesity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Secondary causes include the use of steroids in children, which can result in obesity. Other secondary causes include <strong>Cushing's syndrome</strong>, <strong>Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome</strong>, <strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong>, and <strong>Pickwickian syndrome</strong>.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Early recognition of children at risk for overweight or already overweight is essential because family counseling and treatment interventions are more likely to be successful before obesity becomes severe.</li>
                <li>History should explore possible predisposing factors, associated comorbidities, and complications.</li>
                <li>Assess dietary and physical activity history, focusing on patterns and potential areas for change.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Physical Examination</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect anthropometric data, including weight, height, and calculation of <strong>BMI</strong>.</li>
                <li>Data should be plotted on age-appropriate and gender-appropriate growth charts and assessed for weight gain trends and upward crossing of percentiles.</li>
                <li>Assess blood pressure, adiposity distribution (<strong>central</strong> versus <strong>generalized</strong>), markers of comorbidities (<strong>acanthosis nigricans</strong>, <strong>hirsutism</strong>, <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>, orthopedic abnormalities), and physical stigmata of genetic syndromes (e.g., <strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong>).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Laboratory Studies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>These are generally reserved for children who are overweight (<strong>BMI &gt; 95th percentile</strong>) or who have evidence of comorbidities or both.</li>
                <li>Useful laboratory tests may include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fasting lipid profile</li>
                    <li>Fasting insulin and glucose levels</li>
                    <li>Liver function tests</li>
                    <li>Thyroid function tests (if there is evidence of plateau)</li>

            <h4>Psychological Effects</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Children can become isolated and develop <strong>depression</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong>, often due to low self-esteem from peer pressure. This may worsen obesity from reduced physical activity.</li>
                <li>Low self-esteem may lead to <strong>eating disorders</strong> such as <strong>bulimia</strong> and <strong>anorexia nervosa</strong>.</li>
                <li>Children may suffer from <strong>chronic fatigue</strong> due to poor sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Physical Health Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asthma:</strong> A significant number of overweight children have asthma.</li>
                <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Type 2 diabetes, formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is increasingly prevalent among overweight children and adolescents. The CDC estimates that one in three American children born in 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime.</li>
                <li>This type of diabetes in the young has been dubbed <strong>‚Äòdiabesity‚Äô</strong>. The global rise in obesity and Type 2 diabetes in children has prompted the International Diabetes Federation to call for urgent action, warning of a twin epidemic.</li>
                <li><strong>Heart Disease:</strong> Early indicators of atherosclerosis, a common cause of heart disease, begin in childhood, often linked to high cholesterol and triglycerides associated with poor eating habits and overweight.</li>
                <li><strong>Gallstones:</strong> The occurrence of gallstones is significantly higher in obese individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>High Blood Pressure:</strong> Overweight children are more likely to develop high blood pressure, further increasing their risk of heart disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Liver Problems:</strong> Obesity increases the risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), also known as fatty liver.</li>
                <li><strong>Menstrual Problems:</strong> Obesity may cause early puberty in girls and can contribute to uterine fibroids or menstrual irregularities later in life.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep Apnea:</strong> Overweight children are at risk for obstructive sleep apnea, a serious breathing disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep, which can lead to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Orthopedic Problems:</strong> Obesity can cause early onset of back and knee pain due to excess weight on the limbs and back, and can lead to deformities such as <strong>tibia varus</strong>. Other musculoskeletal issues include <strong>slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>The management of childhood obesity involves the whole family, not just the child, because family lifestyle may contribute to the development of obesity.</li>
                <li>Social support is crucial to encourage the child to lose weight.</li>
                <li>Parents must take the lead in helping their child reach and maintain a healthy weight, as they have the most control over their child's activities and habits.</li>
                <li>The child‚Äôs physician and nutritionist play a role in diagnosing, monitoring, and encouraging the child to lose weight.</li>
                <li>Community involvement is essential, as seen in initiatives like Michelle Obama‚Äôs <strong>‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Move‚Äô</strong> program, which promotes healthier meals in fast food restaurants and increased physical activity in schools.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Psychological Management</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Family support is the most important factor; the obese child should not be singled out, and the entire family should adopt a healthy lifestyle.</li>
                <li>Parents should encourage their child, show love, avoid criticism, and set a good example by practicing healthy habits.</li>
                <li>Parents should be empathetic, especially towards children who are anxious or isolating themselves from peers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Dietary Management</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Aim for a gradual weight loss of about <strong>1 kg per month</strong> to ensure sustainable weight management.</li>
                <li>Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
                <li>Reduce fatty meal intake and provide low-fat milk for childr

            <h4>Dietary</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Families need to be counseled on age-appropriate and healthy eating patterns starting from infancy.</li>
                <li>Promote breastfeeding.</li>
                <li>Emphasize the transition to complementary and table foods for infants and the importance of regularly scheduled meals and snacks instead of grazing.</li>
                <li>Encourage age-appropriate portion sizes for meals and snacks.</li>
                <li>Teach children to recognize hunger and satiety cues, guided by reasonable portions and healthy food choices by parents.</li>
                <li>Children should never be forced to eat when they are not hungry, and food should not be overemphasized as a reward.</li>
                <li>Parents should avoid:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forcing the child to eat when not hungry.</li>
                        <li>Insisting that the child finishes their meal.</li>
                        <li>Allowing the child to rush through meals.</li>
                        <li>Using food as a reward or source of comfort.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Physical Activity</h4>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The importance of physical activity should be emphasized. Options include organized sports, school-based activities, or activities of daily living such as walking more, using stairs, and engaging in active play.</li>
                <li>Time spent in sedentary behaviors, such as television viewing and video/computer games, should be minimized.</li>
                <li>Television in children's rooms is linked to more screen time and higher rates of overweight, and parents should be made aware of these risks.</li>
                <li>Clinicians may need to help families find alternatives to sedentary activities, especially if there are barriers like unsafe neighborhoods or lack of supervision after school.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Benefits of Physical Activity in Children</h4>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Encourages weight loss and helps maintain a healthy weight.</li>
                <li>Lowers blood pressure.</li>
                <li>Improves self-esteem.</li>
                <li>Strengthens bones.</li>
                <li>Reduces stress.</li>
                <li>In weight reduction, energy output through exercises should be greater than energy intake.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Good Sleep</h4>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduled sleep times help children lose weight, as poor sleep can lead to fatigue, sluggishness, and increased daytime sleepiness, contributing to weight gain.</li>
