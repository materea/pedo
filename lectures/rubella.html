            <p>Communicable but often mild viral infections, which may be asymptomatic (without a rash and/or fever), are frequently associated with an exanthema of variable morphology, and exhibit a fairly characteristic tender enlargement of the retro-auricular, posterior cervical, and sub-occipital lymph nodes. Post-natally acquired rubella is usually mild and uncomplicated in infants and children, in contrast to adolescents and adults, in whom the infection might lead to arthropathy and purpuric lesions.</p>
            <p>Rubella continues to be of significant concern in the pediatric context due to the severe embryopathy linked with congenital infection (in the fetus) resulting from the placental dissemination of viremia in an infected mother. This well-known condition is termed <strong>Congenital Rubella Syndrome</strong>, a prenatal disease characterized by a range of possible manifestations and varying degrees of severity (explained further below).</p>

            <p>The Rubella virus is a pleomorphic single-stranded lipid-enveloped RNA virus with three structural proteins: a nucleocapsid protein and two glycoproteins (E1 and E2) present in the envelope.</p>
            <p>It belongs to the <strong>Togaviridae</strong> family, genus <strong>Rubivirus</strong>.</p>
            <p>The virus is sensitive to heat (thermosensitive) and UV-light, but it remains stable at cold temperatures below 4¬∞C.</p>
            <p>Humans are the exclusive known host and reservoir of the infection.</p>
            <p>Growth of the virus can be sustained in African Green Monkey Kidneys cell lines. While no characteristic Cytopathic Effect (CPE) is observed (unlike the Warthin-Finkeldey Giant cells seen in Measles), indirect identification is possible by noting the resistance of rubella-infected cells to subsequent challenge with enteroviruses.</p>
            <p>Transmission may occur through viral shedding in nasal and pharyngeal secretions, blood, and urine of the infected individuals.</p>
            <p>The period of maximum communicability spans five days before the appearance of the rash and six days after. However, virus detection can continue up to about 14 days post-eruption. In cases of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS), virus detection in body fluids may persist for one to one-and-a-half years.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Worldwide, seroepidemiological surveys in most countries (except Trinidad and Tobago) indicate recent or past infection (sero-conversion) in 70 ‚Äì 95% of females between adolescence and the end of reproductive life.</li>
              <li>Google data suggest that the disease is rare in Nigeria, with fewer than 10,000 cases reported annually, as stated by the College of Medicine of the University of Ibadan in South-West Nigeria.</li>
              <li>An earlier report from Trinidad highlighted very low seropositivity, indicating that sero-negative females are at a high risk of prenatal fetal infection and the associated embryopathy (congenital rubella).</li>
              <li>The risk of severe malformations in Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) is highest during the first trimester of pregnancy, particularly before the 8th week of prenatal life. The first half of pregnancy in seronegative females carries a risk as high as 85%.</li>
              <li>The risk of malformation may be:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>85 ‚Äì 90% if maternal infection occurs before 11 weeks</li>
                <li>33% between 11 ‚Äì 12 weeks</li>
                <li>11% between 13 ‚Äì 14 weeks</li>
                <li>24% between 15 ‚Äì 16 weeks</li>
              </ul>
              <li>There is a low but definite risk if maternal infection occurs after 16 weeks. Late infections are associated with variable sensorineural hearing impairment.</li>

              <li>Rubella transmission occurs via:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Droplet propagation and acquisition</li>
                <li>Direct or indirect contact with fomites contaminated by nasopharyngeal discharge, urine, and other body effluents</li>
              </ul>
              <li>It is less contagious compared to measles (rubeola), with contagiousness varying based on housing conditions, crowding, and ventilation adequacy.</li>
              <li>The incubation period is 14 ‚Äì 21 days, similar to Mumps and varicella (chickenpox).</li>
              <li>Infectivity spans from the immediate post-incubation (prodromal period) to about one week after the rash appears. For Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS), body effluents remain infectious for about one to one-and-a-half years.</li>
              <li>CRS arises from severe virus infection in early pregnancy and is associated with:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Virus interference with organ formation due to direct inhibition of mitosis, resulting in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)</li>
                <li>Fetal or embryonic cells providing an excellent tissue culture for the rubella virus</li>
                <li>Virus multiplication and spread in the fetus due to inadequate levels of virus-specific antibodies to limit spread</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Rubella virus inhibits cell growth via mitosis, causing prenatal IUGR and low birth weight (LBW). This inhibition appears to persist postnatally, leading to failure in acquiring adequate catch-up growth.</li>
              <li>Children with CRS have reduced ability to clear the virus post-birth. Despite persisting Hemagglutination Inhibition Antibodies (HIA), urine, Nasopharyngeal Aspirates (NPA), and stool of infants with CRS remain infective for the subsequent 12 ‚Äì 18 months.</li>
              <li>Seizures, thrombocytopenia, and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) may be observed in children with CRS.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Pathological findings are observed in nearly every organ/system in affected infants, particularly those infected early. Late fetal affectation is less severe due to the placenta acting as a better barrier and cells being less vulnerable to infection.</li>
              <li>In infants with CRS, cellular and tissue damage are common pathological events leading to dysmorphogenesis and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).</li>
              <li>The fundamental cause of pathological events in CRS is tissue necrosis resulting from:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Ischemia or vascular insufficiency</li>
                <li>Reduced cellular multiplication time</li>
                <li>Chromosomal 'fractures' or breaks</li>
                <li>Production of a protein inhibitor responsible for causing mitotic arrests in specific cell types</li>
              </ul>
              <li>CRS is characterized by the chronicity of these pathological events, with the virus persisting in fetal cells. Once infected in early embryonic life, cellular-level infection continues well beyond delivery, leading to ongoing tissue damage and virus reactivation.</li>

            <p>The diagnosis of rubella is primarily based on clinical presentation and supported by laboratory tests. Here are some diagnostic clues and laboratory findings:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Clinical Presentation:</strong> The clinical symptoms and characteristic rash are essential diagnostic clues.</li>
            <li><strong>Laboratory Tests:</strong>
               <ul>
               <li>Throat swab, NPA, urine, and feces samples are suitable for viral identification in the initial phase.</li>
               <li>Serology: Detection of rubella-specific IgM or IgG using ELISA is commonly used for diagnosis.</li>
               <li>Paired sera: A four-fold rise in IgG or IgM antibody levels between acute and convalescent phases is characteristic.</li>
               <li>CSF Analysis: Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may show nonspecific pleocytosis and a modest rise in protein levels.</li>
               <li>False Negative in CRS: In cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), serology tests may give false-negative results due to competing circulating IgG.</li>
               <li>Advanced Testing: In some cases, advanced tests like RT-PCR or viral culture in African Green Monkey Kidney (AGMK) cell lines may be necessary.</li>

            <p>Rubella infection can lead to various complications, and the prognosis depends on the timing of infection and the presence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Here are some key points:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Complications:</strong>
               <ul>
               <li><strong>Encephalitis:</strong> Rare in post-natally acquired cases, occurring in approximately 1 out of 6000 cases.</li>
               <li><strong>Arthritis and Arthralgia:</strong> Seen more commonly in adolescent girls, involving several joints and may resemble juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).</li>
               <li><strong>Encephalitis:</strong> Encephalitis is usually mild, but progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRPE) may occur, resembling subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prenatal Infections:</strong> The major concern is prenatal rubella infections, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy, as this is associated with a high risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).</li>
            <li><strong>Prognosis:</strong>
               <ul>
               <li><strong>Postnatal Rubella:</strong> The prognosis for self-limiting postnatal rubella infections is generally good, with recovery expected.</li>
               <li><strong>Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS):</strong> In cases of CRS, the prognosis is more serious, and there is a higher risk of death or prolonged handicaps.</li>
               </ul>

            <p>The treatment approach for rubella depends on the specific situation. Here are some considerations:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Postnatal Rubella:</strong>
               <p>Postnatal rubella infection is usually self-limiting and does not require specific treatment in many cases. Complications are rare in most individuals, except for certain groups:</p>
               <ul>
               <li><strong>Pregnant Adolescents, Young and Older Adults:</strong> In pregnant individuals, especially adolescents and young or older adults, rubella infection can have more severe implications. These groups are at a higher risk of complications and adverse outcomes.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Adolescent Females and Young Adults:</strong>
               <p>Adolescent females and young adult females who have not been previously exposed to the rubella virus or immunized against it are particularly vulnerable. If they contract rubella infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, there is a high risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).</p>
               <p>For individuals in these high-risk groups, appropriate management and counseling are essential to ensure the best possible outcomes.</p>

            <p>Rubella is a vaccine-preventable disease with the following preventive measures:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Rubella Vaccine:</strong>
               <p>The rubella vaccine, known as RA 27/3, is a live vaccine that is often administered in combination with measles and mumps vaccines as MMR, or with varicella vaccine as MMRV. The vaccine is given in a 2-dose regimen:</p>
               <ul>
               <li><strong>First Dose:</strong> Administered between 12 and 15 months of age.</li>
               <li><strong>Second Dose:</strong> Given shortly before school entry, between 4 and 6 years of age.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis:</strong>
               <p>The rubella vaccine can also provide potential preventive value for post-exposure prophylaxis. If given within 3 days of suspected exposure, it can help prevent infection.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contraindications:</strong>
               <p>The rubella vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant females due to the risk of vaccine-induced congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). However, if a patient becomes pregnant within 4 weeks of immunization, the potential risk of CRS should be explained to the patient and family. Therapeutic abortion is rarely needed in such cases due to the very small risk from recent studies.</p>
               <p>It is also contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals, especially children with HIV/AIDS. Fever is <strong>not</strong> a contraindication to receiving the vaccine.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Adverse Reactions:</strong>
               <p>Adverse reactions to the RA 27/3 vaccine may include:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>Fever</li>
               <li>Rash</li>
               <li>Arthritis and/or Arthralgia: More common among post-pubertal girls, with around 10% experiencing these symptoms. Tendonitis may also occur occasionally.</li>
               <li>Rarely, Peripheral Neuropathies</li>
               <li>Transient Thrombocytopenia: Occasional occurrence in vaccine recipients.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
