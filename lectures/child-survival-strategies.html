              <h4>Intervention</h4>
              <p>
                During the last two decades, child survival in developing countries has been given a prominent place in the world agenda. The realization that of 20 million children born each year in Africa, 4 million will die before their 5th birthday has led to the child survival initiative project.

            <p><strong>Child Survival Strategies (CSS)</strong> was a brain child of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) following the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978.</p>
            <p>These strategies comprise <em>low-cost technologies</em> believed to be affordable to nations, communities, and individuals.</p>
            <p>The primary aim of these technologies is to <em>reduce childhood mortalities</em>, which are most prevalent in the developing world.</p>
            <p><strong>CSS</strong> was established as a means of promoting <em>accelerated and sustained action</em> towards achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4).</p>
            
            <p><strong>CSS</strong> followed a process&hellip;</p>
            <p><em>Core versus Non-Core</em></p>
            <p><strong>1st Strategy: Growth Monitoring, Oral Rehydration, Breastfeeding, and Immunization (GOBI)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>2nd Strategy: GOBI plus Female Education, Family Planning, Food Supplementation, and Follow-up (GOBI plus FFFF)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>3rd Strategy: GOBIFFFF plus Essential Care for Every Newborn, Training in Home Management of Fever, and Hygiene (GOBIFFFF plus EETH)</strong></p>
            
            <p>With time, other low-cost technologies were added. These components are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Female education</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Family planning</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Food supplementation</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Follow-up</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The acronym then became <strong>GOBIFFF</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>These strategies have further been enlarged to include several other Primary Health Care (PHC) activities such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Environmental Protection and Adequate Sanitation</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Essential Drugs Programme</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Treatment of Common Diseases</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Health Education</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The acronym now stands as <strong>GOBIFFFFEETH</strong>.</p>

        <div class='body'>
            <p><em>Growth Monitoring</em> involves regularly measuring a child's size to document their growth.</p>
            <p>The child's measurements are then plotted on a growth chart, which is crucial for detecting early changes in their growth patterns.</p>
            <p>Abnormal growth rates‚Äîeither too slow or too fast‚Äîmay indicate underlying nutritional or health issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Growth Monitoring</strong> is an integral component of primary health care.</p>
            <p>It serves as an early warning mechanism, as the detection of growth faltering allows for timely and appropriate nutritional intervention.</p>
            <p>Encouraging mothers' participation in weighing their children and offering rewards to mothers of children on the path to health can further enhance the effectiveness of growth monitoring efforts.</p>

              <li>Give newborn infants no other food or drink other than breast milk unless medically indicated.</li>
              <li>Practice rooming-in, allow mother and infant to remain together 24 hours a day.</li>
              <li>Encourage breastfeeding on demand.</li>
              <li>Give no artificial teats or pacifiers to breastfeeding infants.</li>

            <p>The possibility that children will become seriously ill or die depends largely on whether their immune systems can fight off infections. Malnutrition, combined with unsanitary or crowded conditions, makes them extremely vulnerable. For instance, measles rarely kills in industrialized countries but can cause up to 40% mortality among infected children in dire and overcrowded situations.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>A two-way relationship between health and nutrition is recognized. Sicknesses increase the possibility of malnutrition and vice-versa.</li>
              <li>Exclusive breastfeeding must be followed by appropriate and adequate complementary diet. Complementary foods that are locally produced can be conveniently and hygienically prepared and at the same time provide optimal nutrient content.</li>
              <li>Prevention of food-borne diarrhea by promoting proper feeding practices, food hygiene, and selection of nutrient-dense locally available foods will facilitate the control of the problem of malnutrition.</li>

              <li>Immunization is essential to save children‚Äôs lives.</li>
              <li>It is also an affordable means of protecting whole communities (herd immunity).</li>
              <li>Immunization has saved over 20 million lives in the last two decades.</li>
              <li>Immunization rate for major vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) has risen from 10% in 1970 to &gt; 80% today. Deaths from measles have declined by over 2/3 in the last decade.</li>
              <li>Immunization aims at reducing morbidity and mortality from VPD.</li>
              <li>Every contact a child has with a health facility should be used as an opportunity for vaccination.</li>

          <p><strong>Population Control and Beyond:</strong></p>
          <p>In many developing countries, family planning programs have primarily focused on controlling population growth. However, family planning can also serve as an indirect intervention to promote child survival.</p>
          <p><strong>Maternal Mortality:</strong></p>
          <p>One important aspect is that maternal mortality risks increase with higher birth orders. By providing family planning options, the risk of maternal mortality can be reduced, benefiting both mothers and children.</p>

          <p><strong>Micronutrient Deficiencies:</strong></p>
          <p>Micronutrient deficiencies, along with macronutrient deficiencies, often in combination with infections, contribute to high under-5 mortality rates.</p>
          <p><strong>Vitamin A Deficiency:</strong></p>
          <p>Approximately 40% of children under 5 experience compromised immune systems due to Vitamin A deficiency, resulting in about 1 million child deaths annually.</p>
          <p><strong>Iodine Deficiency:</strong></p>
          <p>Previously, approximately 18 million babies used to be born mentally impaired due to iodine deficiency, emphasizing the importance of proper nutrition.</p>
          <p><strong>Iron Deficiency:</strong></p>
          <p>Iron deficiency affects mental development in children aged 6 to 24 months, impacting 40‚Äì60% of children in this age group.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance of Vitamin A:</strong></p>
          <p>Vitamin A is essential for immune system functioning, making it crucial for child health.</p>
          <p><strong>Impact of Vitamin A Supplements:</strong></p>
          <p>Taking Vitamin A supplements every 4‚Äì6 months can reduce child mortality by 23% from all causes. It also reduces mortality from diarrhea by about 33‚Äì40% and from measles by 50%.</p>
          <p><strong>Food Fortification:</strong></p>
          <p>Various supplements, like iodine and iron, are used to fortify foods and prevent deficiencies in populations.</p>

            <li><strong>Filling, Grading, and Drainage:</strong> Modifying landscapes to prevent water accumulation and reduce vector breeding sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Zooprophylaxis:</strong> Utilizing animals to divert vectors away from humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Marsh Alteration:</strong> Modifying marshlands through actions like ditching and impoundments to reduce vector habitats.</li>
