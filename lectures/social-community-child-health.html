            <a aria-hidden='true' href='#header-2'>Social Impact of Child Illnesses</a>
          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>The social impact of child illnesses can be seen at different levels, from the individual child to the wider community and society.</p>
            
            <h4>Environment</h4>
            
            <p>The environment in which a child is born and grows up can have a significant impact on their health. For example, children born in poverty are more likely to experience health problems, such as malnutrition and infectious diseases.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Intra-uterine environment: The environment in the womb can also affect a child's health. For example, exposure to pollutants or infections during pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects or other health problems.</li>
            <li>Immediate post-partum: The period immediately after birth is also a critical time for a child's health. Babies who are not properly cared for in the first few weeks of life are more likely to develop health problems.</li>
            <li>Under-5: Children under the age of 5 are especially vulnerable to health problems. This is because their immune systems are not fully developed, and they are more likely to be exposed to infectious diseases.</li>
            <li>School Children: School children are also at risk of health problems, such as asthma, allergies, and mental health problems.</li>
            <li>Adolescents: Adolescents are at risk of a variety of health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, mental health problems, and injuries.</li>
            <li>Young Adults: Young adults are at risk of health problems, such as substance abuse, mental health problems, and chronic diseases.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Levels</h4>
            
            <p>The social impact of child illnesses can also be seen at different levels:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>The child: Child illness can have a significant impact on the child's physical, emotional, and social development.</li>
            <li>Family: The family is often the primary caregiver for a sick child. This can place a financial and emotional burden on the family.</li>
            <li>Community: Child illness can have a negative impact on the community, as children who are sick may not be able to attend school or participate in other activities.</li>
            <li>Government: Governments play an important role in addressing the social impact of child illnesses. They can provide financial assistance to families, support programs to improve child health, and develop policies to prevent illness.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Politics</h4>
            
            <p>The social impact of child illnesses is also influenced by politics. The positions that people hold in government, the decisions that they make, and the resources that they allocate can all have a significant impact on the health of children.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Positions (who occupies which position): The people who hold positions in government can make a big difference in the way that child illnesses are addressed. For example, a government that is committed to improving child health is more likely to allocate resources to programs that support child health.</li>
            <li>Decision (on everything): The decisions that governments make about child health can also have a significant impact. For example, a government that decides to cut funding for child health programs is likely to have a negative impact on the health of children.</li>
            <li>Resource mobilization: Governments can also play a role in mobilizing resources to address child illnesses. For example, they can raise taxes or issue bonds to raise money for child health programs.</li>
            <li>Resource allocation: Governments also need to allocate resources effectively to address child illnesses. This means making sure that the resources are used in the most effective way possible to improve child health.</li>
            <li>Resource utilization: Finally, governments need to make sure that

            <p><strong>Types</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sexually Abused Children:</strong> Those who have experienced various forms of sexual abuse.</li>

                <li>Physical sexual abuse</li>
                <li>Verbal sexual abuse</li>

                <li>Exhibitionism</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Sexually Exploited Children:</strong> Those subjected to commercial sexual exploitation, child prostitution, trafficking, and pornography.</li>
              <li><strong>Street Children:</strong> Those who live and work on the streets, often without proper care or supervision.</li>
              <li><strong>Children in War or Armed Conflict:</strong> Those who are exposed to violence and armed conflict.</li>
              <li><strong>Children in Famine:</strong> Those who suffer from extreme food scarcity and malnutrition.</li>
              <li><strong>Children in Dysfunctional Homes or Family:</strong> Those who come from troubled households that may lack stability and care.</li>
