                <li>The goals of respiration are to provide oxygen to the tissues and to remove carbon dioxide. To achieve these goals, respiration occurs through four major functions:</li>
                <li>Pulmonary ventilation which involves the inflow and outflow of air between the atmosphere and the alveoli.</li>
                <li>Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the blood ‚Äì gas exchange.</li>

               <ul>
                <li>Involves sequential expansion and emptying of the lungs in two ways.</li>
                <li>Mechanical processes involved consist of</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>Downward and upward movement of the diaphragm (to lengthen or shorten the chest cavity) or</li>
                  <li>The elevation and depression of the ribs (to increase or decrease the antero-posterior diameter of the chest cavity).</li>
                 </ol>
                 <li>Compliance - describe the distensibility of tissues and organs of the respiratory pump such as the lungs and chest wall. The higher the compliance, the larger the delivered volume per unit changes in pressure. </li>
                 <li>Alveolar surface tension affects the compliance of the lungs. If the surface tension is not kept low, there is the inevitable tendency for the alveoli to collapse at smaller volumes during expiration. </li>
                 <li>Resistance ‚Äì describes the inherent capacity of the air conducting system (e.g. airways) and tissues to oppose airflow towards the lungs.</li>
                 <li>Airway resistance depends on the radii of the airways (total cross-sectional area), the length of airways, the flow rate, and the density and viscosity of gas.</li>
                 <li>In general, resistance is governed principally by Poiseuille‚Äôs law stated as:R = 8 lŒ∑ √∑ œÄr4</li>
                 <li>(where R - resistance, Œ∑ - viscosity, l - length, and r ‚Äì radius).</li>
                 <li>Thus, airway resistance is inversely proportional to its radius raised to the 4th power. If the airway lumen is decreased by half, there is a corresponding 16-fold increase in the resistance.</li>
                 <li>Newborns and infants with their inherently smaller airways are especially prone to marked increase in airway resistance from inflamed tissues and secretions. This age-related difference airway dimension accounts for why croup and bronchiolitis are almost entirely confined to infants and pre-school children.</li>
                 <li>Also, in patients with increased airway resistance (as is the case in bronchiolitis and pneumonia), a fast respiratory rate does not allow enough pressure equilibration to occur between the proximal airway and the alveoli, with a resulting tendency to develop hypoxia.</li>

                <li>Gaseous exchange in the respiratory system occurs only in the terminal segments of the airway.</li>
                <li>The gas occupying the part of the respiratory system that is not available for gas exchange with pulmonary capillary blood constitutes the dead space.</li>
                <li>This space comprises the anatomic dead space (respiratory system volume exclusive of alveoli), and the physiologic (total) dead space (volume of gas not equilibrating with blood).</li>
                <li>In healthy individuals, the two dead spaces are identical. However, in disease states such as atelectasis and pneumonia, there may be no exchange between the gas in some of the alveoli and the blood, either as a result of compensatory under-perfusion or over-ventilation of some of the alveoli.</li>
                <li>Gas exchange occurs by the process of diffusion and equilibration of alveolar gas with pulmonary capillary blood.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Diffusion depends on</p>
               <ul>
                <li>The expansive surface area of the lungs which promotes extensive diffusion, and</li>
                <li>The amount of available time for equilibration.</li>
                <li>The minute diffusion distance of the thin alveolar and capillary walls (the alveolar-capillary barrier is less than 0.5 mm in thickness) enhances the rate of diffusion.</li>
                <li>In health, the equilibration of alveolar gas and pulmonary capillary blood is complete for both oxygen and carbon dioxide.</li>
                <li>In diseases in which alveolo-capillary barrier is abnormally increased (alveolo-interstitial diseases), and/or when the time available for equilibration is decreased (increased blood flow velocity) diffusion is incomplete.</li>

                <li>The saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen is expressed as a percent saturation in which each gram of normal haemoglobin can hold 1.34 milliliters of oxygen.</li>
                <li>The dissolved fraction is dependent upon the partial pressure of oxygen.</li>
                <li>Under normal conditions each 100ml of blood contains about 20 ml of oxygen bound to haemoglobin and about 0.3 ml dissolved in plasma</li>
                <li>The dissolved fraction is available to tissues first, and then the fraction bound to haemoglobin.</li>
                <li>As tissues metabolize oxygen or if oxygen transport is inadequate, the dissolved oxygen and the haemoglobin-bound oxygen will eventually become depleted.</li>
                <li>The pulse oximeter calculates the percent of oxyhemoglobin from the total hemoglobin present.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The delivery of oxygen to a particular tissue depends on:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>The amount of O<sub>2</sub> entering the lungs,</li>
                <li>The adequacy of pulmonary gas exchange,</li>
                <li>The blood flow to the tissue, and</li>
                <li>The capacity of the blood to carry O<sub>2</sub>.</li>

               <ul>
                <li>The control and maintenance of normal breathing are largely within the respiratory control centers (bulbopontine region of the brainstem).</li>
                <li>Neurons within this area of the brain respond to multiple afferent inputs to modulate their own inherent rhythmicity and provide efferent output to the respiratory control muscles.</li>
                <li>Multiple afferent inputs induce modulation of the central respiratory center efferent outputs to the respiratory and airway muscles and lungs.</li>
                <li>Among these inputs are signals from central and peripheral chemoreceptors, pulmonary stretch receptors, cortical and reticuloactivating system neurons.</li>
                <li>The carotid bodies detect changes in PO2, PCO2, pH,</li>
                <li>The medullary chemoreceptor monitors PCO2 and pH alone.</li>
                <li>The ventilatory drive is stimulated by PO2 and PCO2 levels, although the body demonstrates far greater sensitivity to PCO2 levels.</li>
                <li>In response to the decrease in pH, the central chemoreceptors stimulate the respiratory center to increase the rate of inspiration. Conversely, an increase in PCO2, and a decrease in pH or PO2, causes the peripheral chemoreceptor to stimulate the respiratory center.</li>

              </h3>
            </header>
            <div class='body'>
               <ul>
                <li>The partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (PCO2) are tightly regulated by the central nervous system.</li>
                <li>Any alteration in their values can be taken as an indication that either the regulatory system (the central control of breathing) or its effector organs (the respiratory muscles and lungs) have become impaired or overwhelmed.</li>
                <li>After being integrated with other afferent (sensory) information from the lungs and chest wall, chemoreceptor activation triggers an increase in the neural output to the respiratory muscles with the resultant physical signs that characterize respiratory distress</li>
                <li>Respiratory distress - a conglomerate of clinical features reflecting respiratory ill health.</li>
                <li>Features - tachypnoea, use of accessory muscles of respiration like the intercostals muscle, lower chest wall indrawing, grunting, hypoxaemia and cyanosis.</li>
                <li>The patient with respiratory distress develops a subjective perception of difficulty in breathing or ‚Äòair hunger‚Äô (dyspnoea) and, consequently an increase in respiratory muscle effort.</li>
                <li>The physical signs of respiratory distress can be explained by:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A decrease in pleural pressure during inspiration,</li>
                  <li>Recruitment of the accessory muscles that do not participate in normal (quiet) breathing at rest,</li>
                  <li>The activation of the dilator muscles of the upper airway as reflected by a visible nasal flaring.</li>
                  <li>Grunting, which is due to decreased lower airway compliance.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Grunting - physiological mechanism that generates high pressure in the alveoli.</li>
                <li>The increase in intrapulmonary pressure at the initial phase of grunting is associated with the epiglottis covering the glottis during expiration. When the epiglottis subsequently opens abruptly, gas rushes past the vocal cords producing the expiratory grunting sound.</li>
                <li>Produced by expiration against a partially closed glottis and is an attempt to maintain positive airway pressure during expiration for as long as possible.</li>
                <li>Grunting -a self-administered form of peak end expiratory pressure. By maintaining a high intrapulmonary pressure, more oxygen is expected to diffuse into the blood in the lungs.</li>
                <li>Beneficial in diseases that produce widespread loss of the functional residual capacity, such as in extensive pneumonic consolidation or one associated with pleural effusion</li>
                <li>It is characteristically seen in infants, and is a sign of severe respiratory difficulty.</li>
                <li>Disappearance of grunting may suggest fatigue.</li>
                <li>End-organ hypoxia of the central nervous system causes lethargy and confusion, sometimes alternating with agitation. The arterial hypoxaemia causes haemoglobin desaturation, which if severe could manifest as central cyanosis.</li>
