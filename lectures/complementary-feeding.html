                          <h4>Exclusive (or Full) Breastfeeding (EBF)</h4>
                          <p>This is defined as when all fluid, energy, and nutrients come from <strong>breast milk</strong>, with the exception of small amounts of <strong>medicinal supplements</strong>. It's noted that this method results in <strong>minimal pathogen exposure</strong>.</p>
                          
                          <h4>Almost EBF</h4>
                          <p>This refers to the use of <strong>water</strong> or other <strong>non-nutritive liquids</strong> in addition to exclusive breastfeeding.</p>
                          
                          <h4>Partial BF</h4>
                          <p>This is defined as mixed feeding with <strong>breast milk</strong> plus <strong>non-human milk</strong>, some <strong>solids</strong>, and other <strong>fluids</strong> as sources of energy and nutrients.</p>
                          

                          <h4>Period of Complementary Feeding (CFg)</h4>
                          <p>This is defined as the time when other <strong>foods</strong> or <strong>liquids</strong> are given along with <strong>breast milk</strong>. It's noted that this was previously referred to as the <strong>"weaning period"</strong>.</p>
                          
                          <h4>Complementary Foods (CFs)</h4>
                          <p>These are defined as <strong>foods</strong> or <strong>liquids</strong> other than breast milk given to young children during the period of complementary feeding.</p>
                          
                          <h4>Transitional Foods (TF)</h4>
                          <p>These are described as <strong>nutrient-dense complementary foods</strong> designed to meet the <strong>nutritional needs</strong> of the child.</p>
                          
                          <h4>Weaning</h4>
                          <p>This is defined as the <strong>complete cessation</strong> of any breastfeeding.</p>

                          <p><strong>Complementary foods</strong> are defined by the <strong>WHO</strong> as any <strong>food</strong> or <strong>liquid</strong> other than breast milk.</p>

                          <p><strong>ESPGHAN</strong> suggested that the term should be applied to <strong>foods</strong> and <strong>liquids</strong> other than breast milk and infant formula.</p>
                          
                          <p><strong>Complementary feeding</strong> is required in the second part of the first year for:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>Nutritional purpose</strong></li>
                              <li><strong>Developmental purpose</strong></li>
                          </ul>
                          
                          <p>Complementary feeding is defined as the process starting when <strong>breast milk alone</strong> is no longer sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of infants, and therefore other <strong>foods</strong> and <strong>liquids</strong> are needed, along with breast milk.</p>
                          
                          <p>The target age range for complementary feeding is generally taken to be <strong>6 to 24 months of age</strong>, even though breastfeeding may continue beyond two years.</p>
                          
                          <h4>Too Early</h4>
                          <p>Should not be introduced before <strong>17 weeks</strong>, as it can be associated with the risk of:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>Infections</strong></li>
                              <li><strong>Obesity</strong></li>
                              <li><strong>Allergies</strong></li>
                          </ul>
                          
                          <h4>Too Late</h4>
                          <p>Later than <strong>26 weeks</strong> can predispose to:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>Malnutrition</strong></li>
                              <li><strong>Nutritional deficiencies</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Timely</strong> ‚Äì Introduced when the need for energy and nutrients exceeds what can be provided through breastfeeding.</li>
                <li><strong>Adequate</strong> ‚Äì Provide sufficient energy, protein, and micronutrients to meet a growing child‚Äôs nutritional needs.</li>

          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <h4>1. Duration of Exclusive Breastfeeding and Age of Introduction of Complementary Foods</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice <strong>exclusive breastfeeding</strong> from birth to <strong>6 months</strong> of age, and introduce complementary foods at <strong>6 months of age (180 days)</strong> while continuing to breastfeed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. Maintenance of Breastfeeding</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until <strong>2 years of age</strong> or beyond.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Practice Responsive Feeding, Applying the Principles of Psychosocial Care</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feed infants directly</strong> and assist older children when they feed themselves, being sensitive to their hunger and satiety cues.</li>
                <li><strong>Feed slowly and patiently</strong>, and encourage children to eat, but do not force them.</li>
                <li>If children refuse many foods, <strong>experiment with different food combinations, tastes, textures, and methods of encouragement</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimize distractions</strong> during meals if the child loses interest easily.</li>
                <li>Remember that feeding times are periods of <strong>learning and love</strong>‚Äîtalk to children during feeding, with eye-to-eye contact.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h4>4. Safe Preparation and Storage of Complementary Foods</h4>
            <p>Practice good hygiene and proper food handling by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Washing caregivers‚Äô and children‚Äôs hands before food preparation and eating.</li>
                <li>Storing foods safely and serving foods immediately after preparation.</li>
                <li>Using clean utensils to prepare and serve food.</li>
                <li>Using clean cups and bowls when feeding children.</li>
                <li>Avoiding the use of feeding bottles, which are difficult to keep clean.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>5. Amount of Complementary Food Needed</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Start at <strong>6 months of age</strong> with small amounts of food and increase the quantity as the child gets older, while maintaining frequent breastfeeding.</li>
                <li>The energy needs from complementary foods for infants with "average" breast milk intake in developing countries are approximately:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>200 kcal per day</strong> at 6-8 months of age</li>
                        <li><strong>300 kcal per day</strong> at 9-11 months of age</li>
                        <li><strong>550 kcal per day</strong> at 12-23 months of age</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In industrialized countries, these estimates differ somewhat (<strong>130, 310, and 580 kcal/day</strong> at 6-8, 9-11, and 12-23 months, respectively) because of differences in average breast milk intake.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>6. Food Consistency</h4>
            <p>Gradually increase food consistency and variety as the infant gets older, adapting to the infant‚Äôs requirements and abilities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Infants can eat <strong>pureed, mashed, and semi-solid foods</strong> beginning at six months.</li>
                <li>By <strong>8 months</strong>, most infants can also eat "<strong>finger foods</strong>" (snacks that can be eaten by children alone).</li>
                <li>By <strong>12 months</strong>, most children can eat the same types of foods as consumed by the rest of the family, keeping in mind the need for <strong>nutrient-dense foods</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>7. Meal Frequency and Energy Density</h4>
            <p>Increase the number of times that the child is fed complementary foods as he/she gets older.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The appropriate number of feedings depends on the <strong>energy density</strong> of the local foods and the usual amounts consumed at each feeding.</li>
                <li>For the average healthy breastfed infant, meals of complementary foods should be provided:
                    <ul>
                        <li>2-3 times per day at <strong>6-8 months of age</strong></li>
                        <li>3-4 times per day at <strong>9-11</strong> and <strong>12-24 months of age</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Additional <strong>nutritious snacks</strong> (such as a piece of fruit, bread, or chapatti with nut paste) can be offered 1-2 times per day, as desired.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>8. Nutrient Content of Complementary Foods</h4>
            <p>Feed a variety of foods to ensure that nutrient needs are met. <strong>Meat, poultry, fish,</strong> or <strong>eggs</strong> should be eaten daily, or as often as possible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetarian diets cannot meet nutrient needs at this age unless <strong>nutrient supplements</strong> or <strong>fortified products</strong> are used.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables</strong> should be eaten daily.</li>
                <li>Provide diets with adequate <strong>fat content</strong>.</li>
                <li>Avoid giving drinks with low nutrient value, such as <strong>tea, coffee,</strong> and sugary drinks like <strong>soda</strong>.</li>
                <li>Limit the amount of <strong>juice</strong> offered to avoid displacing more nutrient-rich foods.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>9. Use of Vitamin-Mineral Supplements or Fortified Products for Infant and Mothers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use <strong>fortified complementary foods</strong> or <strong>vitamin-mineral supplements</strong> for the infant, as needed.</li>
                <li>In some populations, breastfeeding mothers may also need vitamin-mineral supplements or fortified products, both for their own health and to ensure normal concentrations of certain nutrients (particularly vitamins) in their breast milk.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>10. Feeding During and After Illness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase fluid intake during illness, including more frequent breastfeeding, and encourage the child to eat <strong>soft, varied, appetizing,</strong> and favorite foods.</li>
                <li>After illness, give food more often than usual and encourage the child to eat more.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Providing sound and culture-specific nutrition counseling to mothers of young children and recommending the widest possible use of indigenous foodstuffs to help ensure that local foods are prepared and fed safely in the home.</li>
                <li>The agriculture sector plays an important role in ensuring that suitable foods for use in complementary feeding are produced, readily available, and affordable.</li>
                <li><strong>Low-cost complementary foods</strong>, prepared with locally available ingredients using suitable small-scale production technologies in community settings, can help meet the nutritional needs of older infants and young children.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrially processed complementary foods</strong> also provide an option for some mothers who have the means to buy them and the knowledge and facilities to prepare and feed them safely. Processed-food products for infants and young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the <strong>Codex Alimentarius Commission</strong> and adhere to the <strong>Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Foods for Infants and Children</strong>.</li>

                <li>Mothers, fathers, and other caregivers should have access to <strong>objective, consistent,</strong> and <strong>complete information</strong> about appropriate feeding practices, free from commercial influence.</li>
                <li>In particular, they need to know about:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>recommended period of exclusive</strong> and continued breastfeeding.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>timing of the introduction of complementary foods</strong>; what types of food to give, how much and how often, and how to feed these foods safely.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Mothers should have access to <strong>skilled support</strong> to help them initiate and sustain appropriate feeding practices, and to prevent difficulties and overcome them when they occur.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledgeable health workers</strong> are well placed to provide this support, which should be a routine part not only of regular prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care but also of services provided for the well baby and sick child.</li>
                <li>Community-based networks offering <strong>mother-to-mother support</strong> and trained breastfeeding counselors working within, or closely with, the health care system also have an important role to play in this regard.</li>
