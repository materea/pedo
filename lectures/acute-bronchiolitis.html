            <p><strong>Age:</strong> Due to anatomical reasons related to the size of the distal respiratory tree (bronchioles), acute viral bronchiolitis is common among children under 2 years of age. The peak incidence occurs between the second and the 10th month of life.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Gender:</strong> There is a male preponderance of cases. Attack rates in males may be 1.5 times greater than in females.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Breastfeeding:</strong> Lack of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Opportunities for Exposure:</strong> Infants of working mothers are exposed early to settings such as day-care centers or creches, indoor crowding, and the presence of older siblings and adults with minor respiratory illnesses.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Seasonal Factors:</strong> In temperate regions, the peak period is during the winter to spring months. However, in the West African subregion, most cases are observed during the rainy season (May-October) or the cold-but-dry harmattan season (November-December) (Johnson et al, 1996).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Others:</strong> Racial factors are reportedly unimportant, but black infants were said to be more vulnerable to parainfluenza type III–associated wheezy illnesses (Welliver et al, 1986). Additionally, unlike in pneumonia, malnutrition is an uncommon associated feature of acute viral bronchiolitis (Johnson, 1993).</p>

            <p><strong>Viral infection</strong> of the infant’s upper respiratory passages usually occurs following inhalation of infected respiratory droplets, or inoculation of the nostrils or conjunctivae from contaminated hands.</p>
            
            <p>The spread of the infection to the <strong>distal bronchi and bronchioles</strong> causes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mucous hypersecretion</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Necrosis of the respiratory epithelium</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Submucosal inflammatory edema</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There is <strong>preservation</strong> of submucosal <strong>collagen</strong> and <strong>elastic tissue</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Subsequently, intraluminal <strong>plugs</strong> of sloughed (<strong>epithelial</strong>) cellular <strong>debris</strong> and <strong>fibrin</strong> are formed.</p>
            
            <p>Characteristically, there is <strong>peribronchiolar infiltration</strong> by <strong>mononuclear cells</strong>, and except those adjoining the inflamed bronchioles, the <strong>alveoli</strong> are relatively spared.</p>
            
            <p>Several <strong>cytokines/chemokines</strong> (notably <strong>interleukin (IL)-8</strong>, <strong>macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]1-α</strong> and <strong>regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)</strong>), <strong>interferon-ү</strong> and <strong>leukotrienes</strong> are released due to <strong>cellular injury</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>The consequent <strong>cellular dysregulation</strong> initiate, orchestrate and sustain <strong>airway inflammation</strong> involving the epithelia of the <strong>distal bronchi</strong> and the <strong>bronchioles</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>By virtue of their smaller dimensions, the <strong>peripheral airway</strong> of infants and toddlers has a greater propensity for <strong>obstruction</strong> (and the related increase in airway resistance) from the <strong>inflammatory edema</strong> and intraluminal <strong>mucus plugs</strong> and <strong>epithelial debris</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Flow of air past the sites of obstruction is aided by the generation of <strong>negative intra-thoracic pressure</strong> (by the active contraction of the diaphragm), but with the generation of <strong>positive pressure at expiration</strong>, there is <strong>dynamic airway compression</strong> with the consequent smaller luminal dimensions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Air-trapping</strong> beyond the site of obstruction causes progressive <strong>hyperinflation</strong> (ball-valve obstruction). The consequent increase in the <strong>functional residual capacity</strong> accounts for the <strong>difficulty and prolongation of the expiratory phase of breathing</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Uneven distribution of <strong>resistance</strong> and a general <strong>decrease in lung compliance</strong> result in a significant increase in the <strong>work of breathing</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Progression of the inflammatory events causes complete (<strong>check-valve</strong>) obstruction in some bronchioles. The consequent absorption of the trapped air causes <strong>multiple but patchy atelectases</strong>, which may be difficult to distinguish from the patchy infiltrates of a complicating bronchopneumonia on the <strong>chest radiograph</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>As the <strong>resistance to airflow</strong> increases, so does the <strong>work of breathing</strong>, volume of trapped (<strong>dead space</strong>) air and the <strong>respiratory rate</strong>. The tendency for developing fast shallow breathing on a high <strong>functional residual capacity</strong> leads to a decreasing amount of <strong>inhaled air</strong> getting to the <strong>alveolar exchange surfaces</strong>. Although the physiological consequence of this is <strong>hypercarpnia</strong> (elevation of arterial PCO2), <strong>hypoxemia</strong> (low arterial O2) appears earlier, due to the inevitable <strong>ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch</strong> associated with the disease. V/Q mismatch is a feature of most hospitalized cases of acute bronchiolitis, and results from relative <strong>hyperperfusion</strong> of poorly ventilated alveoli (occasioned by inflammatory obstruction of the peripheral airway). That the low arterial O2 frequently outlasts clinical improvement underscores the slow resolution of the initial inflammatory events.</p>

            <p>The <strong>typical clinical scenario</strong> is that of an infant or toddler below 2 years, presenting with an initial <strong>coryzal illness</strong> during the vulnerable wet season (rainy season or winter), frequently in close temporal association with (a preceding exposure to) an older contact with an undifferentiated upper respiratory illness.</p>
            
            <p>This initial <strong>prodrome</strong> of <strong>clear rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, excessive sneezing</strong> and <strong>cough</strong> is associated with a mild <strong>fever</strong> lasting for <strong>1 – 7 days</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>The <strong>definitive disease</strong> is heralded by a <strong>sudden onset of wheezy breathlessness</strong>, <strong>episodic or paroxysmal cough</strong>, <strong>irritability</strong>, <strong>poor feeding</strong>, and (especially in tropical environments where malaria may coexist) an exacerbation of the initial <strong>pyrexia</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cough</strong> and <strong>wheezing</strong> may be minimal in the neonates/younger infants in whom <strong>apnoea</strong> is a more frequent presenting feature.</p>
            
            <p>Those requiring admission will usually present with <strong>severe symptoms</strong> within the first <strong>3-4 days</strong> of the definitive stage.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Examination-</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Fast breathing</strong> for the age, <strong>chest retraction</strong>, and <strong>tachycardia</strong> are near-constant findings;</li>
              <li>An occasional child may present with <strong>grunting</strong> and/or <strong>cyanosis</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Auscultatory rhonchi</strong> (typically expiratory and polyphonic) and <strong>fine inspiratory crepitations</strong> may be associated with (non-auscultatory) <strong>wheezing</strong>, which is usually suggested by the prolonged expiration (“visible wheeze”).</li>
              <li>The temperature may range from <strong>38.0 – 40°C</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Irritability</strong> (or sometimes <strong>lethargy</strong>), <strong>cyanosis</strong>, features of <strong>“increased work of breathing”</strong></li>
              <li><strong>A palpable liver</strong> is consequent on the <strong>hyperinflation</strong>, as is <strong>splenomegaly</strong>.</li>
              <li>Other findings include those of <strong>co-morbid conditions</strong> like <strong>otitis media</strong> (seen in ~20% of cases), or complications like a <strong>bacterial pneumonia</strong> (usually associated with unusual bacterial agents), <strong>dehydration</strong> or <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The natural course</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>An initial <strong>48-72 hours</strong> of a <strong>frightening severity</strong> of the respiratory distress with the attendant <strong>highest risk</strong> of precipitous respiratory/metabolic decompensation causing a <strong>fatal outcome</strong> in a few (<strong>&lt; 1%</strong>).</li>
              <li>In the majority of affected children, there is a <strong>gradual resolution</strong> of the respiratory distress, an <strong>improvement</strong> in the paroxysms of cough, fever, appetite and other features over the subsequent <strong>1-2 weeks</strong>.</li>

            <p>The management is <strong>essentially supportive care</strong>. In hospitalized cases, the goals comprise:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Supporting the child</strong> to mitigate the consequences of airway obstruction and the related mismatch of ventilation and lung perfusion.</li>
              <li><strong>Ascertaining the presence of (and initiating appropriate measures for) complications.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Protecting other children at risk.</strong></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The important elements of <strong>supportive care in acute bronchiolitis</strong>, categorized under these three goals, include:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Oxygen Therapy:</strong> Humidified oxygen at a concentration of <strong>30-40%</strong> will suffice.</li>
              <li><strong>Amelioration of Fever and Control of Environmental Temperature:</strong> Use of <strong>antipyretics (especially paracetamol)</strong> and providing a <strong>thermoneutral environment</strong> like an incubator or a radiant warmer for the affected infant.</li>
              <li><strong>Provision of Additional Fluid and Feeds:</strong> Besides judicious fluid supplementation, there is a need to provide additional calories via frequent <strong>small-volume, calorie-dense nutrients</strong>. Breast-fed infants will need to be offered more frequently than before the illness.</li>
              <li><strong>Antimicrobial/Antibiotic Therapy:</strong> Specific antimicrobial agents are <strong>rarely required</strong> in the majority of cases of this predominantly viral disease. <strong>Ribavirin</strong> for RSV bronchiolitis is reportedly associated with more rapid viral shedding and overall clinical improvement.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Ribavirin</strong> is administered as small particle aerosol via an oxygen hood or ventilator as a <strong>3-5 day course</strong>, comprising <strong>12-20 hours of treatment per day</strong>. It is recommended for mortality-prone infants with bronchiolitis.</p>
            <p>The use of <strong>antibiotics or antibacterial chemotherapy</strong> should be individualized for those with <strong>superimposed bacterial pneumonia</strong>, based on a combination of clinical and radiographic parameters. The choice of an antibacterial agent must take cognizance of <strong>Staphylococcus species</strong> in addition to the usual agents associated with community-acquired pneumonia.</p>

              <li><strong>Trial of Bronchodilators:</strong> Consideration of bronchodilators for management.</li>
              <li><strong>Nasal Decongestion:</strong> The potential benefit of nasal decongestion in infants with bronchiolitis lies in the fact that most infants are obligate nasal breathers. Nasal decongestion will not only ameliorate the respiratory distress but enhance oral intake of fluids and calories. Intermittent gentle suctioning of the nostrils and the nasopharynx (with or without saline nasal drops) using a suctioning machine in hospitalized infants and parent-assisted mouth to nose clearing of secretions in ambulatory cases are useful adjunctive treatment measures.</li>
