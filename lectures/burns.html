        <div class='body'>
            <p>Burns usually are classified on the basis of four criteria: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depth of injury </li>
                <li>Percent of body surface area involved </li>
                <li>Location of the burn </li>
                <li>Association with other injuries </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Depth of burns </h4>
            <p>The depth of injury should be assessed by the clinical appearance. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First-degree burns are red, painful, and dry. These burns are superficial, with damage limited to the epidermis. They are commonly seen with sun exposure or with mild, hot solid or scald injuries. They heal in 3 to 6 days without scarring. First-degree burns are not included in burn surface area calculations. </li>
                <li>Second-degree, or partial-thickness, burns may be superficial (red, painful, mottled, blistered) and heal in 10 to 21 days with little or no scarring or deep dermal (pale, painful, and yellow), taking 3 weeks to heal and possibly resulting in scarring. They may result from immersion or flames. </li>
                <li>Third-degree burns are full thickness and require grafts if they are more than 1 cm in diameter. They are avascular and are characterized by coagulation necrosis. </li>
                <li>Fourth-degree burns involve underlying fascia, muscle, or bone. </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Percent of body surface area involved</h4>
            <p>A severe burn includes: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Greater than 15% of the body surface area </li>
                <li>Involves the face or perineum. </li>
                <li>Second-degree and third-degree burns of the hands or feet </li>
                <li>Circumferential burns of the extremities </li>
                <li>Inhalation injuries resulting in bronchospasm and impaired pulmonary function also must be considered severe burns. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The location of the burn</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The location of the burn is important in assessing the risk for disability. </li>
                <li>The risk is greatest when the face, eyes, ears, feet, perineum, or hands are involved. </li>
                <li>With partial-thickness burns, generally no disability results; however, full-thickness burns usually result in permanent impairment. </li>
                <li>Inhalation injuries not only cause respiratory compromise, but also may result in difficulty in eating and drinking. </li>
                <li>Inhalation injuries also may be associated with burns of the face and neck. </li>

                   <p>A careful history is extremely important. </p>

                   <ul>
                    <li>scald burn to the side of face, neck, and arm if liquid is pulled from a table or stove; </li>

                    <li>palm of hand contact with a hot stove. </li>
                    <li>"glove or stocking" burns of hands and feet, single-area deep burns on the trunk, buttocks, or back, and small-area, full-thickness burns (cigarette burns) in young children should raise the suspicion of child abuse. </li>

                   </ol>

                   <h4>Estimation of Body Surface Area of Burn. </h4>
                   <ul>
                    <li>The variable growth rate of the head and extremities throughout childhood makes it necessary to use surface area charts, such as that modified by Lund and Brower </li>
                    <li>The "rule of nines" used in adults may be used only in children older than age 14 years or as a very rough estimate to institute therapy before transfer to a burn center. </li>
                    <li>In small burns under 10% of BSA, the "rule of palm" may be used, especially in outpatient settings. The area from the wrist crease to finger crease (the palm) in the child equals 1% of the child's BSA. </li>
                    <li>The most accurate yet time-consuming method of determining skin involvement is with the Lund and Browder chart. </li>
                   </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The goal of initial treatment is to </li>
                    <li>Stop the burning process; this includes </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Removing the patient from the site of injury, </li>
                        <li>Cleansing away any chemical or injurious contactants, and </li>
                        <li>Removing the clothing. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The next priority is airway management </li>
                    <li>Few signs of injury may be present initially, although facial burns, singed nasal hairs or eyebrows, and acute inflammation of the oropharynx suggest inhalation injury. </li>
                    <li>Smoke inhalation may be associated with carbon monoxide toxicity; 100% humidified oxygen should be given if hypoxia or inhalation is suspected. Hoarseness on vocalization also is consistent with a supraglottic injury. Some children with inhalation burns require endoscopy, an artificial airway, and mechanical ventilation. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Fluid resuscitation </h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The systemic capillary leak that occurs after a serious burn makes initial fluid and electrolyte support of a burned child crucial. </li>
                    <li>The first priority is to support the circulating blood volume, via IV fluids to provide maintenance fluid and electrolyte requirements and to replace ongoing burn-related losses. </li>
                    <li>The resuscitation formula for fluid therapy must provide replacement fluid and maintenance fluid and is determined by the percent of body surface burned. </li>
                    <li>Amount of IV fluid in first 24 hours = weight in kg X 4 mL X % BSA burned </li>
                    <li>Administer one half of the calculated fluid during the first 8 hours and one half of the calculated fluid in the subsequent 16 hours. </li>
                    <li>The starting time is considered to be the time at which the burn occurred and not the time at which medical care is initiated. </li>
                    <li>Children aged 6 months to 5 years should receive the fluid recommended by calculations using the Parkland formula plus maintenance during the first 24 hours. </li>
                    <li>Urine output is the criterion standard for gauging appropriate intravascular volume and hydration status. </li>
                    <li>During the second 24 hours, dextrose in 0.25 normal saline is substituted for this regimen. </li>
                    <li>Colloid therapy may be needed for burns covering more than 30% of body surface area and may be provided after 24 hours of successful resuscitation with crystalloids </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Provision of energy requirements </h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Children with significant burns require immediate nutritional support. </li>
                    <li>Enteral feeding may be resumed on day 2 or 3 of therapy </li>
                    <li>Children with critical burn injury may require parenteral nutrition if unable to tolerate full enteral feeds. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Pain control </h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Effective management of anxiety and pain (with sedation and analgesia) and </li>
                    <li>The prevention of hypothermia by maintenance of a neutral thermal environment. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Wound care </h4>

                  <h4>Surgical Care </h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Clean burned areas using isotonic sodium chloride solution or mild soap and water, taking care to maintain thermal homeostasis. </li>
                    <li>Remove ruptured blisters and devitalized epidermis with forceps and scissors or, more efficiently, by rubbing with gauze soaked in isotonic sodium chloride solution after an adequate level of analgesia is obtained. </li>
                    <li>Leave intact blisters alone. </li>
                    <li>Apply a topical antimicrobial (silver sulfadiazine, bacitracin) followed by a sterile dressing after the burn has been cleaned and debrided. </li>
                    <li>Dressings should be changed and wounds cleaned daily in outpatients. </li>
                    <li>Incision of burned skin (escharotomy) is the treatment for compartment syndrome. </li>
                    <li>For full-thickness burns, skin autografting and artificial skin substitutes are required for eventual closure. </li>
                  </ul>

            <li>More than 600,000 children sustain burns each year; 92% occur in the home.</li>
            <li>Prevention is possible by using smoke and fire alarms, having identifiable escape routes and a fire extinguisher, and reducing hot water temperature to 49¬∞C (120¬∞F). </li>
            <li>Immersion full-thickness burns develop after 1 second at 70¬∞C (158¬∞F), after 5 seconds at 60¬∞C (140¬∞F), after 30 seconds at 54.5¬∞C (130¬∞F), after 60 seconds at 53¬∞C (127¬∞F), after 5 minutes at 50¬∞C (122¬∞F), and after 10 minutes at 49¬∞C (120¬∞F). </li>

           <h4>Education on burns prevention</h4>
           <p>This includes </p>
           <ul>
            <li>Making children and parents realize the danger of careless handling of fire and fire-causing materials like matches </li>
            <li>Cooking should be at a higher level where the children cannot easily reach, and the position of the fire should not be easily overturned. </li>
            <li>Cooking should be done with utensils that can be easily handled and-not with "handless" pots. The handles must be made of materials that are poor conductors of heat. The pots should have good covers </li>
            <li>Houses should be better designed, well-planned and ventilated and overcrowding must not be allowed. </li>
            <li>Epileptics, children and the infirm must not be left alone near open fire. </li>
            <li>Care must be taken in the storage and use of kerosene and gas. </li>
            <li>Hot cooking stoves must be cool before refilling. </li>
            <li>Petrol should not be stored in the house and no open flames should be present when petrol and such inflammable fluids are exposed. </li>
            <li>Candles must be put out before sleeping </li>
            <li>Knowledge of how to prevent burns should take place as part of health education programmes on radio and television. </li>
            <li>Formation of society groups on burns prevention. </li>
            <li>Fire drills at various places </li>
