            <p>T-cell lymphoma primarily affects adolescents and young adults. The exact cause of this cancer is unknown, but several predisposing factors have been identified, including viral infections and familial susceptibility, often linked to specific HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) antigen status.</p>
            
            <p>The disease typically manifests as progressive, painless enlargement of lymph nodes. T-cell lymphoma presents in three distinct forms:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Childhood Form:</strong> Occurs in individuals under 15 years of age.</li>
              <li><strong>Young Adult Form:</strong> Affects those between 15 and 34 years old.</li>
              <li><strong>Older Adult Form:</strong> Occurs in individuals aged 55 to 74 years. It's noteworthy that there are two age peaks for this cancer, one between 15 and 35 years and another in individuals older than 50 years, although cases under 5 years are unusual.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Common clinical features of T-cell lymphoma include lymphadenopathy, which is observed in approximately 90% of cases.</p>

            <p>T-cell lymphoma exhibits several pathological characteristics, including:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV):</strong> This virus is often associated with the development of T-cell lymphoma.</li>
              <li><strong>Two Main Classes:</strong> T-cell lymphoma can be categorized into two primary classes:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant:</strong> This is one of the classes of T-cell lymphoma.</li>
                <li><strong>Classical Hodgkin's Disease (HD):</strong> The second major class, which can be further divided into four histologic subtypes:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Lymphocyte Rich:</strong> A subtype characterized by a high presence of lymphocytes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Nodular Sclerosis (Most Common):</strong> The most prevalent subtype of classical HD.</li>
                  <li><strong>Mixed Cellularity:</strong> Another subtype with mixed cell types.</li>
                  <li><strong>Lymphocyte Depletion:</strong> A subtype with a notable absence of lymphocytes.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Reed-Sternberg Cell:</strong> A distinctive cell type commonly found in classical HD.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Infiltrating Cells:</strong> In addition to Reed-Sternberg cells, these tumors often contain lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells.</li>

            <p>Hodgkin's lymphoma is classified into different stages according to the Ann Arbor Staging system. These stages help describe the extent and severity of the disease. The stages are categorized as follows:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stage I:</strong> Involves either a single lymph node region (I) or a single extralymphatic site (IE).</li>
              <li><strong>Stage II:</strong> Includes at least two lymph node regions (II) or one localized extralymphatic site plus at least one lymph node region on the same side of the diaphragm (IIE).</li>
              <li><strong>Stage III:</strong> Encompasses lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (III) with or without a localized extralymphatic site (IIIE), involvement of the spleen (IIIS), or both (IIISE).</li>
              <li><strong>Stage IV:</strong> Characterized by diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic sites (EL) with or without associated lymph node enlargement.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The suffix "A" or "B" is added to indicate the presence or absence of systemic symptoms:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>A:</strong> Absence of systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss.</li>
              <li><strong>B:</strong> Presence of systemic symptoms, including fever and weight loss.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In addition to these stages, "bulky disease" may be specified if certain criteria are met:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Mediastinal mass larger than one-third of the thoracic diameter.</li>

            <p>Diagnosing and staging Hodgkin's Lymphoma typically involves several investigations and tests. These may include:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lymph Node Biopsy:</strong> A biopsy of an affected lymph node is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</li>
              <li><strong>Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Blood Chemistry:</strong> These blood tests help assess general health, detect anemia, and evaluate organ function.</li>
              <li><strong>Imaging Studies:</strong> Various imaging techniques, such as CT scans, PET scans, and X-rays, are used to visualize affected areas, identify lymph nodes, and assess the extent of the disease.</li>
              <li><strong>Bone Marrow Trephine Biopsy:</strong> A bone marrow biopsy may be performed to determine if the disease has spread to the bone marrow.</li>
              <li><strong>Lymphangiography:</strong> This specialized imaging procedure involves injecting a contrast agent to visualize the lymphatic system, helping identify affected lymph nodes.</li>
              <li><strong>Liver Function Tests (LFT):</strong> These tests assess the functioning of the liver, which can be affected by Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Studies Necessary for Clinical Staging of Hodgkin's Disease</h4>
            <p>Accurate staging of Hodgkin's Disease is essential for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. To achieve this, several diagnostic studies and tests are typically performed, including:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Measurement of Palpable Lymph Nodes, Liver, and Spleen:</strong> Physical examination to assess the size of lymph nodes and abdominal organs.</li>
              <li><strong>Complete Blood Cell Count:</strong> Blood test to evaluate red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.</li>
              <li><strong>Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):</strong> Measurement of the rate at which red blood cells settle in a tube, which can indicate inflammation.</li>
              <li><strong>Serum Ferritin:</strong> Blood test to assess iron storage levels in the body.</li>
              <li><strong>Serum Copper:</strong> Measurement of copper levels in the blood, which can be altered in certain conditions.</li>
              <li><strong>Liver Function Tests:</strong> Blood tests to assess the functioning of the liver.</li>
              <li><strong>Chest Radiograph with Measurement of Mediastinal Ratio:</strong> X-ray of the chest to evaluate the mediastinal area.</li>
              <li><strong>Chest CT with Contrast Medium Enhancement:</strong> Detailed imaging of the chest with contrast medium to assess lymph nodes and organs.</li>
              <li><strong>Neck CT (if High Cervical Nodes Palpable):</strong> Imaging of the neck area if there are palpable lymph nodes in this region.</li>
              <li><strong>Abdominal CT or MRI:</strong> Imaging of the abdomen to assess organ involvement.</li>
              <li><strong>Gallium Scan:</strong> Nuclear medicine scan using radioactive gallium to detect areas of inflammation and lymph node activity.</li>
              <li><strong>Bone Marrow Biopsy (with Advanced Disease or "B" Symptoms):</strong> Sampling of bone marrow tissue to assess involvement by Hodgkin's Disease.</li>
              <li><strong>Bone Scan (with Elevated Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Level and/or Bone Pain):</strong> Nuclear medicine scan to evaluate bone health and detect abnormalities.</li>
            </ul>
